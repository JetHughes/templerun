**DESCRIPTION:**
<br> A virtual reality (VR) head-mounted-display (HMD) utilised game based on the mobile game [Temple Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Run).
- First-Person POV
- Creature (**monkey?**) chasing you, can physically turn around and see this
- Collision with objects as you are running towards them, possibly decrease your speed or lose a life
- Physically move your head (**whole-body, how do we encourage this?**) left and right to dodge the passing obstacles
- 360Â° video to show the sky (**maybe only display on the top half of environment**), path/objects will be built in Unity
- Track of distance travelled (**or time alive?**)

**POINTS TO NOTE:**
- Spherical collision map rather than cubic or other as we may have a problem with lag without the tethered connection. 
- World-Space coordinate tracking for the collision with the player.
